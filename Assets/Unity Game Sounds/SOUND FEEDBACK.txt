A man gasps_AOS01311
	the man sounds shocked, and the man should really sound more confused, like, 
	huh? what was that sound? (hopefully still a wordless sound though)
	
	-no, look for somethin else (see above)

CRASH GLASS WINE DROP BREAK 02
	I'm not sure how our glass will look, but I think this sound can work for the milk bottle
	
	-yes, for milk bottle and maybe 

EFT EXT Breaking Plates
	I like the second breaking sound, at about 0:05. Also like the one at 0:24 
		(get both and we'll see which one matches the plate model and texture better)
	
	also, a sound for dragging/kicking the plate along the ground can be gotten from the
		sliding sound at like 0:12, 0:42 (tiny plate piece), 
		from like 30-36 there are sounds after the initial break of the plate
			those sounds can cut and repeated to sound like kicking plate shards
			
	-edit
		- 2 breaking sounds, described at top
		- 3-5 different repeating selections for broken plate pieces sliding on the ground
			~ test these by copying and pasting each sound after itself and try to make it so you cannot even tell the sound it being looped

EFT EXT Small Glass Shatter 01
	Wow there is so much after sound with the glass hitting wood after,
		legit sounds like it's recorded on a pirate ship 
		
	-no
	
EFT EXT Small Glass Shatter 08
	I don't like how there's two parts to the sound, it doesn't seem generic enough to
		match throwing glasses at stone brick walls and stone tile floors
		
EFX INT Barefoot FS 01 A
	Sounds like on wood, also there's a lot of crackling (no clean footsteps)
	
	-no
	
EFX INT Martha into darkness FS
	I am pretty sure our floor is going to be stone tiles, and this is definitely on wood
	(I think we changed it from wood -> stone on Wednesday when we looked at some sources)
	
	-no

FOLEY PLASTIC BUCKET SMALL HIT SETTLE HOLLOW WOOD 01
	the bucket it plastic and the floor is wood, so probably not
	but there is this settling sound at like 0:01.5 or so that might be nice
	
	-probably not
	
FOLEY WATER DROP ON METAL 01
	Definitely a UI sound, might be usable as a "you can't click or do that" sound
	
	-maybe
	
FOOTSTEP 104
	Sounds like a man in boots, and I like it for our guard footsteps.
		at 0:10-0:12 the footsteps are slow, maybe sample from there?
		
	-yes, guard footsteps
	
Rock drop small pebble single_BLASTWAVEFX_23001
	Idk if we will have a pebble to put into the game, but this is perfect for it
	
	-keep just in case
	
Special effect hit break glass light bulb_BLASTWAVEFX_11282
	This to me sounds more like a glass cup breaking than the one for the milk bottle
	
	There's the initial hit that's good, and add maybe the tail end of the tiny sliding glass
		bits onto the end of it? Is it possible to make that sound ok? 
		I don't like the reverberating sound or the middle of it
	
	This could just be good enough, maybe I'm just being too picky
	
	-yes, for glass cup
